# Neu Programming Language

Neu is a new programming language under active development, currently focused on learning language design and Rust implementation practices. It serves as a personal educational project intended primarily for gaining a deeper understanding of interpreters, compilers, and Rust programming.
It is a simple, dynamically-typed programming language, currently interpreted through a tree-walk interpreter approach inspired by the excellent resource ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
